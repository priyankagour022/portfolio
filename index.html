                <p>Hello, I'm Priyanka Gour, a first-year MCA student at the University of Hyderabad. I have a strong foundation in programming languages such as Java, Python, C, C++, and SQL, as well as their associated frameworks. 
                <br><br>
                I have extensive experience working on projects related to web development and machine learning, which has helped me develop a diverse skillset. As an enthusiastic coder, I'm passionate about exploring new technologies and solving complex problems. I'm a quick learner and always ready to take on new challenges. 
                <br><br>
                As a fresher, I'm excited to work in a dynamic and challenging environment where I can learn and grow. With my skills and experience, I'm confident that I can make a meaningful contribution to any team.</p>

                <h3>Parkinson's Disease Indentification and Prediction</h3>
                    <img src="project1.webp" alt="Project 1" height="300px" width="700px">
                    
                    <p>Parkinson's disease is a neurological disorder that affects millions of people around the world. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential for managing the symptoms and improving the quality of life of those affected by the disease.
<br><br>
In this machine learning project, we aim to identify and predict Parkinson's disease using machine learning algorithms. We will use a dataset of biomedical voice measurements from people with and without Parkinson's disease, and train machine learning models to accurately classify individuals based on their voice features.
<br><br>
We will explore several machine learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, and K-Nearest Neighbors, to identify the best-performing model for Parkinson's disease prediction.
<br><br>
Once we have trained and validated our model, we will deploy it as a web application to make it accessible to anyone who needs it. This project can potentially contribute to early detection and diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, and help improve the quality of life for those affected by the disease.
<br><br>
By showcasing this project on a portfolio website, we can demonstrate our skills in machine learning and data science, as well as our commitment to using technology to make a positive impact on people's lives.

                    <h3>Canteen Management System</h3>
                    <img src="project2.jpg" alt="Project 2" height="300px" width="800px">
                    
                    <p>
                    The Canteen Management System is a web-based application that aims to streamline and manage the operations of a canteen. 
                    This system provides a platform for the canteen staff to manage and automate the ordering process, inventory management, 
                    payment collection, and generate reports.
                    <br><br>
                    The system has several modules that cater to different functionalities such as the menu management module, order 
                    management module, payment module, and report generation module. The menu management module allows the canteen staff to 
                    add, modify or delete items from the menu list. The order management module enables the customers to place their orders 
                    online, while the staff can view and manage the orders from their dashboard.
                    <br><br>
                    The payment module allows the customers to pay for their orders online or choose to pay later, and the staff can collect
                     payments, and manage the payment records. The report generation module generates reports on various aspects such as sales
                      report, inventory report, payment report, and customer order history, helping the canteen staff to make informed decisions.
                      <br><br>
                      Technologies used:
                      The project will be developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. The project will be hosted on a web server, and 
                      the database will be stored in a MySQL database.
                      <br><br>
                      Benefits of the project:
                      The Canteen Management System aims to provide a seamless experience for the canteen staff and customers. It will eliminate 
                      the manual processes of order taking, payment collection, and report generation, reducing the workload of the canteen staff.
                       The system will increase the efficiency of the canteen operations, improve the accuracy of the order taking and payment
                        collection, and provide real-time access to the sales data and inventory status.
                        <br><br>
                        Conclusion:
                        The Canteen Management System is an essential tool for any canteen, cafeteria, or food court, providing a centralized
                        platform for managing the canteen operations. The project showcases my web development skills and my ability to create
                        efficient and user-friendly web applications.</p>
